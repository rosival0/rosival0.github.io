    <h1>
            Everybody Gets High
    </h1>
    Once upon a time in a land far away<br>
There lived a little boy and he drank all day<br>
Friends called him stupid and his brothers called him gay<br>
Emptied all the bottles 'til the pain went away<br>
<br>
Whiskey was his friend<br>
He didn't have another<br>
Vicodin his vice<br>
<br>
His real and only lover<br>
Yup<br>
Smoked a pack or two<br>
It never was a problem<br>
Popped a pill or two<br>
They really made him blossom<br>
Yup<br>
<br>
Take a sip, take a sip, take a sip<br>
And I trip, and I trip, and I trip<br>
And I'm like<br>
Run you bitch, run you bitch, run you bitch<br>
Counterfeit hypocrite holy shit<br>
<br>
Everybody gets high<br>
Why the hell can't I?<br>
Everybody gets high<br>
Why the hell can't I?<br>
Everybody gets high<br>
Why the hell can't I?<br>
Everybody gets high<br>
Why the hell can't I?<br>
